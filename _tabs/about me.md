I was born at Kecskemét, Hungary in 1993, and settled down in this little town with my beautiful wife and daughter.

After finishing the secondary school I have graduated as an Electrical Engineer Msc at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, with the main faculty of Computer-based systems and Applied electronics as minor.
Due to this my heart will always be into the low level electronics and code, although I am working on a different stack in the last few years.

In the meantime I started an MBA at the Eötvös Lóránd University and started to focus on my management skills too.

My past works were at [Bosch](https://www.bosch.com/), and at [Flex](https://flex.com/) with the collaboration of the [Beko Engineering Ltd.](https://beko.hu/). Currently I am working at [Digitlean Ltd.](https://digitlean.com/) as the Chief Technology Officer, which is a little startup in Hungary with tha aim to provide a tool for the manufacturing companies, which with they can increase their efficiency.

My nail of interest is really wide, but I will try to narrow it down to the tech related stuff on this little blog.

In my free time I really like to play chess, watching films, discussing politics and coding.
