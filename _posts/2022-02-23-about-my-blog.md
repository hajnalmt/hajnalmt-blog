By the time most of the developers feel like, that it would be really cool, to share their thoughts online about the stuff they deal with every day.
This happened to be the case with me too, so I spinned up this little site, to have the platform to do this, and document some of these little stuff.

I hope to have some more content on the site, but this post seems to be a good start.
